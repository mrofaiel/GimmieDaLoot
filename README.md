# GimmieDaLoot
A 3D Unity game that consists of four cat characters that are based on each group member. The cat's goal is to defeat the dog enemies and collect four pieces of loot that also each represent each member. Once all four pieces have been collected the game will have been completed.

## Group Members
1.) Marcelina Rofaiel
2.) Zahraa Alsafar
3.) Samantha Velazquez
4.) Kevin Le

## Current Target For Halfway Point
- One playable cat that has basic movement (i.e. walk), a working weapon, and 3rd person camera
- One zombie dog enemy that chases the player and bites
- One loot to pickup
- Basic health bar and lighting

## General Goals
- **Marcelina:** Create a graveyard/old city map. Will add a piece of loot to the map that  when it collides with the player, the item has been collected.
- **Zahraa:** Will create a dog that will have a radius that detects player tag if the player is within it's radius. This dog will then begin to attack the player. 
- **Samantha:** Will design the cat character, zombie dog enemy, gun weapon, and UI for the HUD.  
- **Kevin:** Will create the fixed third person camera that is conncected to the cat and has ability to hold a weapon that actually works and inflicts damage.
